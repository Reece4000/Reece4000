- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Reece4000

I'm a bioscience graduate, currently undertaking a part-time MSc in Computer Science from the University of Bath. 

My goal is to expand my knowledge of the practical and theoretical concepts of computer science, and hopefully transition towards a career in software development.

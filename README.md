- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Reece4000

I'm a bioscience graduate, currently undertaking an online MSc in Computer Science from the University of Bath. 

My goal is to expand my knowledge of the practical and theoretical concepts of computer science, and hopefully transition towards a career in software development.
